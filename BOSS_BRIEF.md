# RollPullers Web Refresh — Monday Demo

## Overview
- **Scope:** Static marketing site for RollPullers with neon industrial art direction, seven fully written pages (Home, Grizzly, Roll Puller™, Accessories, Custom Equipment, Consulting, Contact) plus shared CSS/JS assets.
- **Source:** `/Users/joshuastone/Desktop/rollpullers` (remote: `github.com/asphaltfabrics1-cpu/rollpullers`). Latest commit: `dffb06e chore: enrich marketing copy across pages`.
- **Deployment target:** Netlify (not yet connected in this repo; ready for plug-in).

## Highlights To Show
1. **Hero & story** – Index hero now explains pain points (labor, deadlines) and links to key CTAs. Stats + timeline visually support credibility.
2. **Product depth** – Dedicated Grizzly/Roll Puller pages outline specs, patented features, upgrade kits, and usage guidance.
3. **Support ecosystem** – Accessories, Custom, Consulting, and Contact pages contain actionable copy, placeholders for contact info, and forms/CTAs.
4. **Design language** – Neon gradient palette, glassy panels, responsive grids, sticky nav, and mobile menu for modern industrial feel.
5. **Copy consistency** – Each page stresses benefits, logistics, and engagement steps with placeholders ready for final contact data.

## Suggested Demo Flow
1. Walk through `index.html` hero → product cards → innovation timeline.
2. Open `grizzly.html` to show specs table + feature grid.
3. Jump to `rollpuller.html` for the container-unloading story.
4. Highlight accessories/custom/consulting sections to prove services coverage.
5. End on `contact.html` to show placeholders + form, reinforcing readiness for leads.

## Next Steps / Gaps
- Replace placeholders (`[Company Name]`, `[Contact Email]`, etc.) with approved details.
- Add photography or video loops under `assets/images/` to maximize hero panels.
- Connect repo to Netlify or run `npx serve`/`python3 -m http.server 5173` for demos.
- Optional: migrate to Vite/React if component reuse or CMS integration is desired.

## Effort Estimate (for boss)
A full redesign of this scope (content gathering, copywriting, visual system, and implementation) typically takes **about 40–60 hours** for a single developer/designer depending on feedback cycles. We compressed it here using automation, but that’s the realistic planning figure for future work.
